This repository contains completed JavaScript exercises from the Foundations section of The Odin Project. The purpose of these exercises is to build practical understanding of core JavaScript concepts through hands-on problem solving and test-driven development.

## Contents

Each folder represents a standalone challenge and focuses on a specific concept or problem. Topics covered include:

- Function creation and scope
- Control flow and loops
- String and array manipulation
- Object properties and comparison
- Basic algorithmic logic

Each exercise includes a JavaScript solution file and a corresponding Jest test file to validate the implementation.
